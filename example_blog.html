                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>When considering my professional life, I think it boils down to three passions of mine:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Software Engineering</b> - Software engineering is quickly reshaping the world around us
                    in some amazing ways. It has also created new problems that we have to navigate. I love
                    being able to use my knowledge to build things that improve lives and having conversations
                    about the implications of technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Effective Altruism</b> - I have always been passionate about charity, but recent
                    conversations in my religious and secular circles have brought light to how well-intentioned
                    charities can be inefficient or even harmful. I think there's still a lot of potential for
                    technology companies to aid this work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Security</b> - Security is such a fascinating field to be in and it has a huge impact.
                    When building security products, you're engaging in a cat and mouse style game to keep
                    ahead of malicious parties. This brings about some exciting
                    challenges and considerations.
                </p>

                    I've got some hobbies that come and go. You can check out my latest photography or see my book
