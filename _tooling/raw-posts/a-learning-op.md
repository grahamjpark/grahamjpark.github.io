# Announcing "A Learning Opportunity"

A couple of months ago, I tried to find a site that covered software vulnerabilities targeted towards engineers. My thought was that by keeping up with recent vulnerabilities, I could learn not to repeat the mistakes myself.

I couldn't find anything, so I decided to try creating a newsletter and see if others were interested. Right now I plan to put out a digest of recent vulnerabilities every two weeks. If that sounds interesting you can check out my most recent one and subscribe here. Feedback is welcome as well!
