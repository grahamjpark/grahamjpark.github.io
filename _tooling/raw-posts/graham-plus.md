## Announcing Graham+

Recently I was checking [ICANNâ€™s list of TLDs](https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt) to see ifÂ .parkÂ was available yet. Unfortunately Iâ€™ll have to keep waiting for my dream domain, graham.park, but while looking over the list I found out thatÂ .plusÂ existed. A quick search showed that graham.plus was available. I joked with my friends that given the number of streaming services popping up lately, it seemed like Graham+ was the next logical step. The joke quickly evolved from a streaming service about my life to a unique way to share my opinion on things (Grahamâ€™s Opinions as a Service, if you will). As an example, Graham + tacos = ðŸ™Œ, meaning that I love tacos.

  

After quickly throwing together a word list, I am pleased to announce that Graham+ is now live: [https://graham.plus](https://graham.plus).
