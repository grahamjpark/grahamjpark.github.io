                <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>When considering my professional life, I think it boils down to three passions of mine:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Software Engineering</b> - Software engineering is quickly reshaping the world around us
                            in some amazing ways. It has also created new problems that we have to navigate. I love
                            being able to use my knowledge to build things that improve lives and having conversations
                            about the implications of technology.</li>
                        <li><b>Effective Altruism</b> - I have always been passionate about charity, but recent
                            conversations in my religious and secular circles have brought light to how well-intentioned
                            charities can be inefficient or even harmful. I think there's still a lot of potential for
                            technology companies to aid this work.</li>
                        <li><b>Security</b> - Security is such a fascinating field to be in and it has a huge impact.
                            When building security products, you're engaging in a cat and mouse style game to keep
                            ahead of malicious parties. This brings about some exciting
                            challenges and considerations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For more on my professional life, check out my Linkedin below. Outside of my professional life, I've
                        got some hobbies that come and go. You can check out my latest photography, see my reading
                        recommendations, or look at my medium posts below as well.</p>
