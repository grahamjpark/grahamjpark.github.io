          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Currently at Purdue University, I'm in my third year studying computer science. I chose security as my focus within computer science because of the challenges that come with it. I love turning a piece of code around and trying to look at it in ways that aren't necessarily apparent. Security also offers a chance to work on some of the most important issues within a company, with real impact on the customers and the company itself, which is a role that I find really cool.</p>
          <p>I also love learning new things and getting new experiences, and that applies within computer science as well as outside of it. Lately I've been trying to get into photography and travel, so feel free to check out my pictures or blog!</p>
